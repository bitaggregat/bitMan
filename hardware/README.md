# Hardware

The schematic is included in this directory as an PDF file.

To modify the board, one can use [EasyEDA PCB Design Software](https://easyeda.com), either as online or offline tool. It is probably sufficient to import the *
bitMan_2025-12-16.epro*-file. The other two *\*.epro*-files are an explicit export of the schematic and the PCB.

All components were sourced from [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com). All resistors and capacitors are in 0603 packages and have no special requirements. For all other components please refer to the MPN (Manufacturer Part Number) in the [BOM](bitMan_BOM_2025_12_16.xlsx) or the schematic of the EasyEDA project files.
